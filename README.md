# MARS
MARS (Modular Asynchronous Rendering System) is a multithreaded optimized c++ rendering engine.

MARS is a set of multiple modules that have as a goal help developers to easily create their high performance rendering engines.

## ðŸš§ Status

This is the **static reflection branch**, where Iâ€™m currently prototyping a full engine rewrite using C++ static reflection via [Bloombergâ€™s Clang fork](https://github.com/bloomberg/clang-p2996), which implements most of the current reflection proposals.

Because this is a WIP branch, some parts are either:
- Missing documentation
- In an experimental state
- Not yet integrated
